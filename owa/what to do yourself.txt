Creates a Simple small menu/plugin (owa); can not find another thing... helas  
menu itself is nameless (made without caption)!!
 (use as menu and put in any area you like/need)

 Simply change the setSiteID to reflect yours; of course sitepath (baseurl) too)
Do this twice > once in menu php and once in track js

Happy analyzing.

The scripting (for owa) is provided by Openwebanalitics and may be updated by them.
The interacting makes use of the e107v2 methods.
