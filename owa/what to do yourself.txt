Creates a Simple small menu/plugin (owa); can not find another thing... helas  
menu itself is nameless (madewithout caption)!!
 (use as menu and put in any area you like/need)

 Simply change the setSiteID to reflect yours; of course sitepath (baseurl) too)
Do this twice > once in menu php and once in track js

Happy analyzing.

The scripting is provide by Openwebanalitics and may be updated by them.
